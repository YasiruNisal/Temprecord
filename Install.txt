Installation Instructions
=========================

 - Copy all the files from the archive trw-setup.zip into a temporary folder.
 - Run the file trw-setup.exe

Installation Notes
==================

Temprecord requires the user to have administrator rights for installation.
After installation, Temprecord will be available to all users of the computer,
whether administrators or limited users.

Folder Use and Permissions
==========================

Installation of Temprecord creates the following folders:

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Temprecord\                                   Default folder for Temprecord (.TR) files
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Temprecord\Reports\                           Default folder for PDF report files
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Temprecord\Application Data\TRW\              Folder for TRW.INI settings file
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Temprecord\Application Data\TRW\Email Files\  Folder for temporary attachment files for emails.  Files remain in here until the email with attachments is successfully sent, when these files are deleted.
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Temprecord\Application Data\TRW\Event Log\    Folder for the event log
C:\Documents and Settings\<User name>\Local Settings\Temp\Temprecord\TRW\Reports\           Folder for temporary PDF files created when PDF preview is used.

These folders are all created with modify permissions for all users, so that
limited users can still run Temprecord, create and save files and email
attachments, etc.

The Temprecord program is generally distributed as a ZIP file
named trw-setup.zip.  Within the ZIP archive are four files:

  - trw-setup.exe                          The setup executable.  Run this
                                           file to install Temprecord.

  - readme.txt                             Late-breaking news and version history

  - Install.txt                            This  file

  - TRW Batch Installation Template.bat    A sample batch file to illustrate
                                           unattended batch installation

NOTE:  The installation ZIP archive file contains EXE and BAT files.  These
file types are often blocked by system administrators because of the fear
they might harbour viruses.  You may need to find alternate ways of
distributing the installable other than email attachments.


INI Files
=========

The way in which Temprecord looks for the INI file on startup is designed 
to allow system administrators to tailor each installation to their needs.

  - TRW first looks in the folder that the executable was started from.  
    If the file TRW.INI is found there then that file is read.
    
  - If the file TRW.INI was not found there TRW looks in the folder:
  
      C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Temprecord\Application Data\TRW\
      
    If the file TRW.INI is found there then that file is read.
      
  - If the file TRW.INI was not found there TRW looks in the folder:
  
      C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>Local Settings\Application Data\Temprecord\TRW\
      
    If the file TRW.INI is found there then that file is read.
    
  - If the file TRW.INI is not found in any of the above 3 locations one is created in:  
      
      C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Temprecord\Application Data\TRW\
      
  - The TRW.INI file is saved back into the folder it was found or 
    created in when TRW exits.


Customizing Installation
========================

If you require your installation to have customized settings, these are
the steps required:

  - unzip all the files in trw-setup.zip to a temporary folder
  - install Temprecord on your computer.
  - open the Options dialog.
  - set any custom options you require.
  - exit Temprecord.
  - open Explorer and navigate to the folder:

      C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Temprecord\TRW

  - copy the file TRW.INI into the temporary folder

The contents of the temporary folder are what you need to distribute as an
installation image.

Batch Installation
==================

The file Batch Installation Template.bat is provided as an example of how
Temprecord can be installed without user intervention in situations where
the installation destination folder is known in advance.  System
administrators should examine this file and edit it to suit their
environment if necessary, although using it in its supplied form will
generally install Temprecord satisfactorily and is recommended.

Kiosk Version
=============

Temprecord supplies a "Kiosk" version of the software, for use in environments
where full access to some Temprecord functions is not required or undesirable.

The Kiosk version installation instructions are the same as above, except that
the executable is called:

      trw-kiosk-setup.exe

and the example installation batch file is called:

      TRW Kiosk Batch Installation Template.bat

If Temprecord and Temprecord Kiosk are both installed on the one computer,
they will be assigned separate program groups and shortcuts, and they will
each have their own INI file and temporary files folders.  Both versions
will still share folders for TR files  and PDF reports.
